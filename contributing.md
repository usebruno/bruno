## Let's make Bruno better, together !!

We are happy that you are looking to improve Bruno. Below are the guidelines to get started bringing up Bruno on your computer.

### Technology Stack

Bruno is built using Next.js and React. We also use electron to ship a desktop version (that supports local collections)

Libraries we use

- CSS - Tailwind
- Code Editors - Codemirror
- State Management - Redux
- Icons - Tabler Icons
- Forms - formik
- Schema Validation - Yup
- Request Client - axios
- Filesystem Watcher - chokidar

### Dependencies

You would need [Node v18.x or the latest LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm 8.x. We use npm workspaces in the project

## Development

Bruno is being developed as a desktop app. You need to load the app by running the Next.js app in one terminal and then run the electron app in another terminal.

### Local Development

```bash
# use nodejs 18 version
nvm use

# install deps
npm i --legacy-peer-deps

# build packages
npm run build:graphql-docs
npm run build:bruno-query
npm run build:bruno-common

# run next app (terminal 1)
npm run dev:web

# run electron app (terminal 2)
npm run dev:electron
```

### Troubleshooting

You might encounter a `Unsupported platform` error when you run `npm install`. To fix this, you will need to delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` and run `npm install`. This should install all the necessary packages needed to run the app.

```shell
# Delete node_modules in sub-directories
find ./ -type d -name "node_modules" -print0 | while read -d $'\0' dir; do
  rm -rf "$dir"
done

# Delete package-lock in sub-directories
find . -type f -name "package-lock.json" -delete
```

### Testing

```bash
# bruno-schema
npm test --workspace=packages/bruno-schema

# bruno-lang
npm test --workspace=packages/bruno-lang
```
