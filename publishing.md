### Publishing Bruno to a new package manager

While our code is open source and available for everyone to use, we kindly request that you reach out to us before considering publication on new package managers. As the creator of Bruno, I hold the trademark `Bruno` for this project and would like to manage its distribution. If you'd like to see Bruno on a new package manager, please raise a GitHub issue.

While the majority of our features are free and open source (which covers REST and GraphQL Apis),
we strive to strike a harmonious balance between open-source principles and sustainability - https://github.com/usebruno/bruno/discussions/269
